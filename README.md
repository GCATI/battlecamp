# BattleCamp

A Wardley Map BattleCamp is an advanced Wardley Map workshop dedicated to teaching and training people (and robots!) to do Gameplay. It's purpose is to show that there are other important phases of the Wardley Map Strategy Cycle, such as "Climactic Patterns", "Doctrine" and "Gameplay".

The **focus** of this workshop is **on playing the "game"**. It's goal is to help attendees to utilize all of the phases of Warley Map Strategy Cycle and understand that you will be doing all of the phases in a real-life scenario.

**You will do all of the phases**.

Not:

- "Im just going to do a gameplay move"
- "Im just going to do a map"
- "Im just going to predict based on a map and some climactic patterns"
- "Im just going to optimize a bit my company using the Doctrines"

The purpose is to do all of the phases and to practice them.

*Note:* This workshop is a "simulation" of a real-life scenario. Consider it as such, a simulation.

## Workshop Structure

### The Goal

To Win. To be the dominant company in the given market.

### Your role and the attendee structure

You are a company board member.

Attendees are divided into two teams with random team members.
*(In real life, you will rarely have the choice over who you work with, so its better to learn to cooperate and create an team atmosphere focusing on a common goal)*

**There needs to be a team of at least two judges which keep track of the workshop statistics and gameplay.**

Each company team belongs to a single company, which is doing business in a single market. Each company has a different scenario.

**Two or three teams of random team members. Minimum 3 members per team. Equal members per team.**

### Game structure

Turn based. Simultaneous turns. Max 40 rounds.
The teams need to be in different rooms.

### Structure

Each company has three main resources.

1. Time (represented in points, each team has 10 time points per round.)
2. Capital (represented in cash, e.g. dollars)
3. Marketshare (represented in percentages)

All companies operate in a single market developing a single product.

## BattleCamp Cards

Cards from the first, initial BattleCamp are going to be open source and in the folder `cards`. We will be slowly adding them.

The card data is contained in the `src/cards.json`. You can change the data there and then use `generate-cards.js` to generate a new set of cards with the updated information and in different colors, text, effects and so on.
