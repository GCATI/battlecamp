# Scenarios

There are many BattleCamp scenarios that are playable, and most can be a variation of the Healthcare Commercial Vaccine Manufacture.

There are two major different scenario types:

- public sector scenarios
- commercial ones

The main differentiation lies in their metrics.

In a public sector setting, as a government official you don't need to gain marketshare, but a reduction of negative effects, while also reducing costs to the government.

The commercial scenarios's focus is on both marketshare and capital gain. You want to increase the marketshare, while also increasing your capital.

**Important:**

1. None of these have been perfectly balanced (as we are living in an unbalanced world)
2. Maps **are political** and are meant to tackle many real-world issues we, humans, face in our daily lives.
3. These scenarios are similar to some real-world situations, as they are meant to help you solve similar situations.

**If you want to add a situation** you would like to map, please do contact me via email. Thank you.
