# Healthcare Commerical Flu Vaccine Manufacture

## The Scenario

You are in a market without a public healthcare system and you are one of two healtcare clinics that are administering and selling a flu vaccine with an average market cost of $100.

The first company is long-running business, with over 50 years. A family made business, with your own offices and laboratories that you have built yourself in the lest 50 years. You have hired nurses, lab assistants and doctors. You also have bought an application from the market for your clinic, to schedule vaccination appointments, communicate with the customers and so on. Charging $120 per flue therapy, with a product cost of $70. Your market share is 18%.

The second company is a recently started business, a clinic with about 5 years on the market. Rents its office space and lab space. You've hired nurses, lab assistants and doctors. Have developed your own application for the clinic with similar options, as your opponent, you "believe you are a healthcare tech startup". Your are charging $100 per flue therapy, with a cost of $55. Your marketshare is 7%.

### Team (Company) Structure

Each company has three main resources.

1. Time (represented in points, each team has 10 time points per round.)
2. Capital (represented in cash, e.g. dollars)
3. Market share (represented in percentages, with a goal to maximize this one)

All companies operate in a single market developing a single product.

## Market and Income

The market size is 100,000 total units sold per quarter (round).

`Market share` * `the total market size` * `your product price` = `your revenue you have made`.

*Example:*
Your market share = 8% ~ `0.08`
Your product price = `$100`

`0.08` * `100,000` * `$100` = `$800,000` revenue / round.

But **this isn't your income.** You must subtract the product cost (which is calculated by using the capital flows of your Wardley Map, if you don't have a map, well, you won't know which components cost the most).
If your product cost is `$80` per product sold, your income would be `$160,000`.

The judges **must** calculate the income each round for each company. The judges **must not** share data between teams.
_(A good team will understand that they should calculate the other team's income too)_

### Product Cost

Product cost is calculated using the Capital Flows of your Wardley Map.

### Product Price Elasticity

The price is elastic in an easy setting.
