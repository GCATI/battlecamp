# Public Sector Scenario - Reduce Hunger Malnourishment

## The Scenario

You and your team of government officials have been selected to deal with one UN's Global Goals _ Zero Hunger, but for your own country. This goal relates to reducing malnourishment and extreme hunger as one if its key priorities. Your goal and main responsibility will be to address and create solutions to mitigate extreme hunger and malnourishment as much as possible, while also reducing cost as much as possible.

You will be randomly assigned to one of the following country sizes.

You are a smaller developing country, just out of its economic crisis, 25 million people. The number of undernourished people is proportionally smaller and is around 100,000. Your agricultural output is 43k tons of wheat with a 3% growth rate. Your initial project funds are 30 million.

You are a large, impoverished country, just out of a civil war, with 150 million people. The percentage of undernourished people is quite big and and around 20 million. Your initial project funds are quite small 40 million, but your large country has a large agricultural growth potential of 25k tons of wheat currently, but 30% growth each year (4 turns).

To help and provide enough amounts of food, it requires more than just producing grains, but distributing food, creating foodstamps programs, social welfare policies, providing citizen documentation, government approvals and regulation, and in some cases fighting corruption, as certain elements in your country want to export food.
