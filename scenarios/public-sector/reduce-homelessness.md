# Public Sector Scenario - Homelessness

## The Scenario

You and your team of government officials have been selected to deal with one of the most important issues of today - homelessness. You and your teammates' government has included reducing homelessness as one if its key priorities. Your goal and main responsibility will be to address and create solutions to mitigate homelessness as much as possible, while also reducing cost as much as possible.

You will be randomly assigned to one of the following country sizes.

You are a smaller country, 30 million people. The number of homeless people is proportionally smaller and is around 100,000. Unfortunately, you have a smaller budget. Your initial project funds are 12 million.

You are a larger country, 200 million people. The number of homeless people is larger and is around 700,000. Though, you have a larger budget. Your initial project funds are 100 million.

To help and house a homeless person, that requires more than just building housing or affordable housing, but creating homelessness programs, social welfare policies, providing homeless citizen documentation, government approvals and regulation, implementing unemployment programs, necessary bank documentation, and in some cases drug addiction rehabilitation programs.

But none of these come without constraints.

## Constraints

Naturally, every country has a set of constraints, which may or may not be helpful in your goal of reducing homelessness.

### Low Public Rating

If the public's trust in your work is compromised, falling below a certain threshold, the Government will replace you, disqualifying you. Teams will have different public ratings depending on their assigned:

1. [78/100] The public holds a view that your actions are helping the homeless, fixing the society, but there is still work to be done.
2. [32/100] The public is suspicious you are doing anything useful.
3. [54/100] The public sees your actions, but nothing to be applauded for.

### Low Internal Government Rating

If your internal government rating falls below a certain threshold, as someone might be undermining you (they want your budget), the Government shall replace you and your team, disqualifing you.

### Public's view of the homeless

In a certain case, you can also include the constraint "public's view of the homeless", which will impact your budget and the both ratings significantly.

The public's view of the homeless can be:

- "most homeless people are without shelter because of circumstances beyond their control"
- "homeless should be helped but not at the cost of the other priorities"
- "homeless people should be able to fend for themselves"

These views can be fixed or modifiable, but they will apply a certain positive or negative bonus to any gameplay that involves public rating.

## Metrics

There will be several key metrics, based on which your team's success will be measured:

- the number and percentage of homeless people in your country, as the primary metric (min)
- spent funds, in taxpayer units. Example: 100 taxpayers per a homeless person (min)
- your team's public ratings [0-100] (max)
- your team's internal government ratings [0-100] (max)

## Team (Government Agency) Structure

Each government agency has three main resources.

1. Time (represented in points, each team has 10 time points per round)
2. Capital (represented in taxpayer money, as a currency)
3. Homelessness (represented in percentages)

All three government agencies operate in different and separate countries.

Taxpayer money - units, $1000 per taxpayer a good measure for spending capital.

## Random Events

- Natural disasters (increasing the number of homeless people)
- Housing and social service budget cuts (minor budget cut for a short period of time)
- Market failure causing an economic crisis (a massive budget cut and an increase of homeless people)
- State increase of rent, increasing your budget, but also the number of homeless people
- Political play aimed at your department, "wasting budget newspaper headlines". (slight loss of the public and minor internal government rating)
- Introduction of a law on the criminalization of homeless
- A scandal involving your government
