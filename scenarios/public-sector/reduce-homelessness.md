# Public Sector Scenario - Homelessness

## The Scenario

You and your team of government officials, have been selected to deal with one of the most important issues of today - homelessness. You and your teammates' government has included reducing homelessness as one if its key priorities. Your goal and main responsibility will be to address and create solutions to mitigate homelessness as much as possible, while also reducing cost as much as possible.

You will be able to choose one of the following country sizes.

You are a smaller country, 30 million people. The number of homeless people is proportionally smaller and is around 100,000. Unfortunately, you have a smaller budget. Your initial project funds are 12 million dollars.

You are a larger country, 200 million people. The number of homeless people is larger and is around 700,000. Though, you have a larger budget. Your initial project funds are 100 million dollars.

To help and house a homeless person, requires more than just building housing or affordable housing, but creating homeless programs, social welfare policies, providing homeless citizen documentation, government approvals and regulation, implementing unemployment programs, necessary bank documentation, and in some cases drug addiction rehabilitation programs.

But none of these come without constraints.

## Constraints

Naturally, every country has a set of constraints, which may or may not be helpful in your goal of reducing homelessness.

### Low Public Rating

If the public's trust in your work is compromised, falling below a certain threshold, the Government will replace you, disqualifying you.

### Low Internal Government Rating

If your internal government rating falls below a certain threshold, the Government shall replace you and your team, disqualifing you.

## Metrics

There will be several key metrics, based on which your team's success will be measured:

- the number and percentage of homeless people in your country, as the primary metric (min)
- spent funds, more precisely the least spent funds, as the secondary one (min)
- your team's public ratings (max)
- your team's internal government ratings (max)

## Team (Governemnt Agency) Structure

Each government agency has three main resources.

1. Time (represented in points, each team has 10 time points per round.)
2. Capital (represented in cash, e.g. dollars)
3. Homelessness (represented in percentages)

All three government agencies operate in different and separate countries.
